      "1. \"Acquire,\" \"hold,\" \"purchase\":\n",
      "   - These terms include cases where a non-citizen obtains a stake in, or an interest in, or continuous use of a property, whether it is a corporate entity or unincorporated.\n",
      "   - It also covers situations where the management of such an entity is vested in one or more persons who are citizens of Mauritius, or where the entity is quoted on a stock exchange and admitted with at least one shareholder who is a citizen of Mauritius.\n",
      "   - In the context of a trust, it refers to transactions involving trusts as per section 22 of the Trusts Act.\n",
      "   - For foundations, it includes cases where a person who is not a citizen of Mauritius acts as a founder, beneficial owner, ultimate beneficial owner, or beneficiary under the Foundations Act.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. \"Property\":\n",
      "   - This term means immovable property located in Mauritius, whether it is freehold or leasehold.\n",
      "   - It also includes rights or interests in immovable property, whether legal or beneficial, and shares in entities that hold such property.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. \"Qualified corporation\":\n",
      "   - A corporation that holds a global business license as defined under the Financial Services Act or a bank holding a banking license issued under the Banking Act, insofar as it relates to banking transactions with non-residents or corporations holding a Global Business Licence or Authorised Company, as the case may be.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. \"Qualified entity\":\n",
      "   - An entity that owns property or where a non-citizen directly or indirectly owns or controls interests in the property.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. \"Resident of Mauritius\":\n",
      "   - For individuals, it means a person domiciled in Mauritius.\n",
      "   - For a body corporate, it refers to a body that is incorporated or registered under the laws of Mauritius.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. \"Share\":\n",
      "   - This term refers to an interest in a company, partnership, société, or other body corporate that holds, disposes of, purchases, or otherwise acquires immovable property in Mauritius.\n",
      "   - It includes shares in partnerships, sociétés, or any body corporate that has among its assets freehold or leasehold immovable property in Mauritius, or shares in a company that holds shares in a subsidiary or in a partnership, société, or body corporate with such assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. \"Shareholder\":\n",
      "   - This term includes any association or body of persons, whether corporate or unincorporated, that is a non-citizen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The section also notes that it has been amended by various Acts, indicating that the definitions have been updated over time to reflect changes in the law.\n",

      "As a law expert, I can provide an analysis of the legal implications for a person from England who wishes to buy property in Mauritius. The relevant law governing the acquisition of property by non-citizens in Mauritius is the Non-Citizens (Property Restriction) Act. Here's how the law applies to this situation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Non-Citizens (Property Restriction) Act**: This Act regulates the acquisition of property by non-citizens in Mauritius. A non-citizen is defined as a person who is not a citizen of Mauritius. According to the Act, non-citizens require approval from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) to acquire property in Mauritius.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Acquisition of Property**: Under the Act, a non-citizen may acquire property for residential purposes within specific schemes approved by the Mauritian government, such as the Integrated Resort Scheme (IRS), the Real Estate Scheme (RES), the Property Development Scheme (PDS), or the Smart City Scheme. These schemes often have minimum investment requirements and provide for the acquisition of a residence permit under certain conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Application for Approval**: To buy property outside of these schemes, a non-citizen must apply for and obtain approval from the PMO. The application must be made in the prescribed manner and is subject to the discretion of the PMO.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Residence Permit**: Non-citizens who purchase property under the approved schemes may also be eligible to apply for a residence permit in Mauritius, subject to meeting certain investment thresholds and other conditions as stipulated by the Mauritian government.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Restrictions**: There are restrictions on the types of property that non-citizens can acquire. For example, non-citizens are generally not allowed to purchase agricultural land unless it is converted for residential or commercial purposes and the acquisition is approved by the PMO.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Leasehold Property**: Non-citizens can acquire leasehold property without the need for approval if the lease is for a term not exceeding 20 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, a person from England can buy property in Mauritius, but they must comply with the Non-Citizens (Property Restriction) Act and any other relevant laws and regulations. They would typically need to purchase property within the approved schemes or obtain approval from the PMO for other types of property. It is advisable for any non-citizen interested in purchasing property in Mauritius to consult with a local attorney who can provide guidance on the application process and ensure compliance with all legal requirements.\n"

      "\n",
      "1. A company is allowed to indemnify its directors and employees against liabilities they may incur in the performance of their duties, except where the law prohibits such indemnification.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The company can also cover the costs incurred by directors and employees in defending or settling claims related to their liabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Any indemnity that is provided in violation of this section is considered void.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The company's constitution may allow for indemnification of directors and employees for costs incurred in legal proceedings, provided they are not found liable for criminal acts or breaches of duty as specified in section 143(1)(c).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. With the approval of the company's board, the company may purchase insurance for its directors and employees to cover liabilities, including criminal liabilities, and legal defense costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. The board is required to keep a record of any indemnities given or insurance effected in the company's interest register, minutes of directors' meetings, and annual report.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. If insurance is obtained for a director or employee, they are not personally liable for the cost of the insurance unless it is proven that the insurance was not fair to the company at the time it was effected.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. The term \"director\" includes current and former officers of the company or its registered agent, and \"employee\" includes current and former employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. \"Indemnify\" means to relieve or excuse from liability, and \"effect insurance\" includes paying for the costs of insurance, whether directly or indirectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "This section provides a framework for companies to support their directors and employees against certain liabilities that may arise during the course of their duties, while also setting out the conditions and limitations for such indemnification and insurance coverage.\n"
